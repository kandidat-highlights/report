\chapter{Discussion}

Here we discuss our amazing results from the method, a lot of tables and stuff. Yay


\section{Performance Measure}%How we calculate precision/validation top k. Consequences etc
We are choosing top 1 user for now. A problem with this blablabla \todo{write more}


\section{Filter Bubble}
An upcoming issue with recommender systems in general is filter bubble.
Filter bubble is a consequence when training the networks on user data. The problem is that users will only be recommended similar information/items to what they have previously liked/encountered, meaning that the users will stay inside their bubble. \\
One of the simple countermeasures against this is if the users themselves are aware of this and actually browse information outside of their comfort zone. This additional information about users will hopefully be taken into account when training the network. \\

\todo{How we treat upvotes/downvotes as interesting, this is in method already. Discuss problems here}

\chapter{The Reddit dataset}\label{appendix:reddit}
The Reddit dataset was retrieved from \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/bubhl/csv_dump_of_reddit_voting_data/}. The dataset was published by the user \textit{ketralnis} who is an employed administrator on Reddit. The data comes directly from the official Reddit databases.
\\\\
The raw data as retrieved contained three fields per data point which represent a user, a post ID and a vote. Every data point in the dataset indicates that a specified user has either up- or down-voted a certain post on Reddit. An excerpt from the dataset looks like shown in Table \ref{table:reddit_raw_excerpt}.

This raw dataset contains $7,405,561$ votes for a total of $31,927$ users and $ 2,046,401$ posts. The dataset only contains votes from users who have actively agreed to make their votes public. The dataset contains up to the latest $1000$ up- and down-votes (for a maximum of $2000$ votes) for each user. The action to either upvote or downvote a post on Reddit is used on the website to rank posts against eachother where an upvote indicates that a user likes a post and a downvote indicates the opposite.

The posts on Reddit are written by users on the platform. A post always has a title, and it always belongs to a so called \textit{subreddit}. The post seen in Figure \ref{fig:example_reddit_post} has the title \textit{Colorized by me: Abraham Lincoln, June 3, 1860} and it belongs to the subreddit \textit{pics}. A subreddit can be seen as a category -- there are many subreddits on Reddit and posts belonging to the same subreddit are usually similar.

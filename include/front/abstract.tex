\section*{Abstract}
Artificial neural networks have in recent years found success in a variety of fields and in this thesis we evaluate if they can be used in place of classic recommender systems. A recurrent neural network was build to automatically recommend users of social platforms content that they would find interesting, in this thesis the website Reddit was used as a the source for training,testing and validation data. Reddit was chosen because of availability of data and that it was naturally labbeld. Several baselines where under consideration such as n-gram based models and a text classification library developed at Facebook. We where able to surpass our baselines and discuss possible extensions and feature work.

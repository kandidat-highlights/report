\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
In todayâ€™s digital age it can be hard keeping track of all the content and conversations on different social platforms such as Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp and Reddit. People do not want to miss the conversations or news that might interest them, but rather get instant feedback when these conversations or news take place. However, the notifications of today are indiscriminate in that it is hard to get notified when something of interest is posted while not being notified too much. Some applications have tried to solve this by allowing manual \textit{mentioning} or \textit{highlighting} of a person to get their attention; Slack is one example of this \parencite{slack}. However, these functions put a constraint on the users where the users themselves need to figure out who might be interested in some content. It is also deemed as bad manners to highlight a person -- or a group of people -- too often. Studies have shown that receiving an excessive amount of notifications can lead to stress \parencite{relaffinity}.
\\\\
One solution to this problem could be an algorithm that when given content from some social platform as input would output specific users that should be notified because they are likely to deem it interesting. An application using such an algorithm would relieve users of the stress caused by an abundance of notifications and contribute to an overall better experience for them. Even if the algorithm would not work perfectly, a lesser amount of irrelevant notifications could potentially make a big difference.
\\\\
Similar problems to the one mentioned above have been solved in other fields such as electronic commerce. Amazon uses a technique called recommender systems to recommend new items for their users \parencite{amazonfiltering}. Their recommender system is not based on artificial neural networks but rather compares the similarity between new products and products that a user has previously bought or rated \parencite{amazonfiltering}. This thesis will evaluate if it is possible to lessen irrelevant notifications by using an artificial neural network. Artificial neural networks are generally better at pattern recognition and clustering compared to other statistical methods \parencite{basheer2000artificial} which motivates their use in this thesis to classify what people are interested in.

\section{Purpose}
The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of using recurrent neural networks to personalise recommendations of text content for users on social platforms.

\section{Problem Description}
To complete the goal of this project, the relation between some content on a social platform and users' interest needs to be modelled. An artificial neural network model will be used and evaluated for this purpose. In order to successfully model the problem, there are a number of factors that must be considered.
\\\\
First of all, in order to use an artificial neural network a dataset which can be used for training is needed. When a dataset is obtained, the artificial neural network must be modelled to capture the relation between the contents of a text and a user's interest. The modelling is a key part of the problem where a lot of experimentation with different parameters is needed to achieve adequate results. Once the best result, given time constraints, has been achieved the model also needs to be compared with some baseline. This is to evaluate whether the model is good in practice or not. These tasks, as described in more detail below,  must be addressed and completed in order to achieve the goal of the project.

\subsection{Selecting a Dataset}\label{sec:select_dataset}
There are many public datasets to choose from, however a dataset needs to satisfy the following constraints for the proposed model to be able to learn from it: 
\vspace*{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It must be sufficiently large
    \item It must be labelled
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{0.25cm}
As part of this project, potential datasets that fulfilled the above constraints were examined to select the most suitable one.

\subsection{Finding Hyperparameters}
Hyperparameters, such as the model's shape, size and how it computes its results, determine the characteristics of the artificial neural network. The chosen hyperparameters for the model will in the end affect its performance. Some of the hyperparameters that were examined are described below:
\vspace*{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depth of network, how many layers the network needs
    \item Width of layers, how many nodes each layer has
    \item Size of embedding matrix
    \item Learning rate
\end{itemize}
More explanation of artificial neural networks and hyperparameters can be found in Chapter \ref{chap:ann} \& \ref{chap:method}.

\subsection{Comparing with a Baseline}
When evaluating the performance of the network one or more baselines are needed as reference points. How well the resulting model compares against existing methods will give an indication to whether using artificial neural networks could be a good choice for solving the problem or not. This comparison fulfils the project's purpose of evaluating the performance of artificial neural networks for the described problem. The baselines will be compared with the model in terms of the statistical measure $F_1$ score (see Equation \ref{eq:f1score}) when giving recommendations.

\section{Scope}
This thesis will evaluate the possibilities of using artificial neural networks to accurately recommend text content to users of a social platform such that it will be interesting to them.

\subsection{Limitations}
This project will mostly be theoretical and will not focus on business applications to the problem.
\\\\
Due  to  technical  limitations  regarding  computing  power  and  available  data,  the number of users that will be considered when making recommendations  will be smaller than what would likely be desired in a commercial implementation. This  is  to  make  the training  of  the  network  take  less  time  and  thereby make it possible to complete more experiments. The total number of users that will be considered when making recommendations will be fixed to the initial number of users in the chosen dataset.
\\\\
One issue that arises when dealing with data from social platforms is the ethical concern regarding integrity. It is not hard to imagine that a system that could tell whether or not something is of interest to a specific person could be abused. The system could perhaps discover areas of interest that a person would have wished to keep private, this is one example of potentially many problems. Although this is an important issue the thesis will not cover this subject.

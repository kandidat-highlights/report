\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
This chapter will present the final result of the project, the hyperparameters used to achieve this result and how it would apply to real world usage.
\section{Baseline results}

\subsection{Ngram vectors  with Cosine similarity}
The ngram model using cosine similarity as comparison function achieved a precision of $0.38$, recall of $0.55$ and a F1 score of $0.45$ (these numbers come from a dataset with a total of five different users)

\subsection{Ngram vectors with Euclidean distance}
